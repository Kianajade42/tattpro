Build an “about” page (about us, about this website, etc…)

An “About” link that shows up on every page, whether the user is logged in or not. You can put this link in your navigation bar if you want.

Clicking the link goes to the “about” page, which will display some info that we will decide later: 
---
On the about page, it will conditionally render: if a user is logged in, it will display “Thanks for being a member, <username>” ... if user is not logged in, it will say “please login or signup.”
